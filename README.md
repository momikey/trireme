## Description

Trireme is a simulator for a hypothetical computer system designed around [balanced ternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/Balanced_ternary) arithmetic.

## Rationale

Although essentially every computer in existence today relies on binary arithmetic, other bases are possible, and they have been used historically. Decimal-based systems were once somewhat common in the US, while the USSR's (mostly experimental) Setun functioned using balanced ternary. Trireme is my attempt at exploring the possibilities offered by the change of this most fundamental level of computing. It's intended for experimenting, education, and a way to see just how many of our assumptions rely on binary.
